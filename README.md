# I-have-watched-this-and-played-that

I always struggled keeping track of stuff that I have watched (movies, shows, or anime), and video games that I have played. And I'm thinking of creating a user script that does just that.

I'll keep this repository for list of ideas to try and figure what works best

* Movies and shows will use imdb.com, anime-planet.com for anime, gamespot.com for video games
* A personal rating from 1-5 will be offerd on these websites
* Rating and time of rating data will be saved to the user script storage
* A website/local website will be offered to show the data and link to their pages in [timeline](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-timeline/) view
